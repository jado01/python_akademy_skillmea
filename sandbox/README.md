# 🧠 Sandbox – Finished Python Exercises

This folder contains **completed and working Python exercises** created during my learning journey in the [Skillmea Python Academy](https://skillmea.sk/).  
Each file represents a small, self-contained script written to practice key programming concepts such as loops, conditions, functions, and dictionaries.

## 📂 Exercises

| File name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `delenie_dvoch_cisel.py` | Simple division program that handles invalid input and division by zero. |
| `delenie_dvoch_cisel_s_funkciami.py` | Division program rewritten using functions for better structure. |
| `funkcie-sucet-troch-cisel.py` | Demonstrates defining and calling functions with multiple parameters. |
| `mini_calculator.py` | Mini calculator using functions and a dictionary to map operations. |
| `priklady_funkcie.py` | General function examples – parameters, return values, and logic. |
| `sucet_cisel.py` | Calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to a user-entered number. |
| `uhadni_cislo-cykly-podmienky.py` | Number guessing game using loops and conditions. |
| `uhadni_cislo-funkcie.py` | The same number guessing game, refactored with functions for better readability. |

## 🧩 Notes
- All scripts are **fully working** and written for learning and practice purposes.  
- They demonstrate gradual progress through Python basics: input handling → conditions → loops → functions → dictionaries.  
- Each file can be run independently from the command line.
